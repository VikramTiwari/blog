Capabilities of human brain can be easily understood by the number of Slack chats we have muted.

If your team is not talking to each other, they are not progressing.
Make sure the talks are structrued properly.
Add different backgrounds and day duties to the mix so that ideas come up from different areas.
Best works when you are facing a challange, could be technical or non-technical.
Thinking out aloud always helps, and when someone looks at problem by p1 from a different angle, their thinking alound might contain the spark needed for someone else to come to a solution.
Listen to understand, not respond.

Bollywood romantic songs are good if listening at 30% volume, in headphones, and not paying attention to them. Otherwise you will be restless.

No system is perfect.
If you deploy a faulty version to google app engine, delete all the working versions and services manually leaving with the faulty default service and then disable the application. You might never be able to deploy anything else on tha app engine.

Communication is the key. It's like a weighted key seen in those adventure movies where you have to put proper weight before you can extract the gem hidden in that temple in the caves otherwise the cave will collapse on you. Finding that limit can be heard but leaving it hanging is not a great idea. Be smart!

Reddit is better than other social media. See outside of your circle and learn something more.

We have been thinking about life on other planets in a wrong way. What if the life is there but since we don't think that it's habitable for humans, it might not contain any. We have found life on earth which lives in pitch dark places as well as hot geysers and volcanoes etc. Why would jupiter and venus be any different? A common claim is that it need atmosphere and energy. What if those aliens are smarter than we thought and thier atmosphere is made out of those sulphuric or nitrogen clouds?

Only issue is, why have they not contacted us yet? Are we in a simulation? If so, why am I even writing this. OnO
