# Angular Material is 1.0

Congrats to Angular-Material team. Finally a stable version of [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) is out. For the lovers of [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) this is a bliss.

Various interesting features:  
- Lots of commonly used elements out of the box  
- Responsive design for all screen resolutions  
- Fluid layouts and elements alignments  
- Great typography using [Roboto Font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)  
- Easy and Multiple Themes support  
- Total Angular support by making use of services and directives  

Even though the framework lacks Tables which is one of the majorly used element on the web, the [discussions](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/796) have already started for the same and we should expect it soon.

With all these features, it is easily one of the best UI frameworks to start with. For those who are using bootstrap along with Angular and feel limited by Angular-Bootstrap, this is a great option to switch to. I am on it! Where are you?
