In today's [Google for India event](http://www.forbes.com/sites/saritharai/2015/12/16/google-slated-for-massive-expansion-in-india-ceo-sundar-pichai-says/) there were various exciting news delivered. Few notables ones are giving free Wi-Fi at 100 railway stations and ramping up Android and other engineering capabilities in India. This comes with the fact that Google is planning massive expansion and its speculated ambition of becoming an ISP in India.

Google's Developers Relations team also announced two products which are focused at growing markets like India.

# [Google Developers Agency Program](https://developers.google.com/agency/)
While there are multiple programs like Google Dev Groups and Women Techmakers are already running and successful, Google tapped into another opportunity of extending its community outreach to Agency teams which were kind of secluded up till now. Now with this program they can train agencies to make better use of their tools and support them in building a better experience for their customers. If you want your app to be developed by professionals, they are also listing a directory of agencies that they will be working with. Even better for Agencies to get onboard!

# [Google Developers Launchpad Accelerator](https://developers.google.com/startups/accelerator/)
In its ongoing effort to tap into markets of developing nations with large upcoming technophiles, this offering came as a reboot to previous offering by Google. The program is truly unique in the sense that its giving all the benefits without asking back anything from the participants. If you aren't so excited about free getting-started funding, how does all-expenses-paid trip training in Google HQ at Mountain View sounds? Not exciting enough for marketing teams? Well, how about you do well and they give you some limelight.

Its about time that startups from emerging nations start to understand the power of local and start building products that are global in quality. For Indian startups this is one of the best things that can happen considering such a huge opportunity for local market. Moreover its happening in your old-favorite city Bangalore! Get going. Best wishes to all the teams which have joined the [first batch of program in India](https://developers.google.com/startups/accelerator/region-india).
