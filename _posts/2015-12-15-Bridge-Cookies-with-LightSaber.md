So Google today released [LightSaber Escape](https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/), a browser based game that turn SmartPhones into Light Sabers. So basically you become a Jedi cruising through an enemy base, trying to escape.

Google demonstrated various capabilities with just one game.

# Running a game in browser
There have always been questions about how good is a browse to run a full fledged game. Well, one more in multiple proof of concepts by Google and others.

# Using a resource based on its form factor
First the ability to hardware resources in realtime and on top making use of gyro and accelerometer to simulate LightSaber actions, poof!

# Features availability regardless of form factor
No matter what device you are using Chrome on, it has all the batteries included. So you can make use of most current browser features all the time.

# Ability to sync devices in near real-time
The use of WebRTC for sync, maintain connection and use that for all the actions. That too considering one of the devices is Mobile which might be on limited bandwidth.

While these are the things that relate to you as a user there are various things that might be happening in the background as well:
- Pairing your desktop and mobile cookies to bridge you across devices  
- Adding Star Wars to your persona to show you relevant info on google now  
- Promoting Star Wars on both Desktop and Mobile at the same time  
- Giving geeks one more tool to play and tinker with  
- Maybe you will get a free ticket to Movie as well. Maybe!  

Well! I tried, tried multiple times. But I guess the force is not strong with me. Go forth Jedi! Conquer the quest.
